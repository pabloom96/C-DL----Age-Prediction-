# C-DL----Age-Prediction-

**SUMMARY:**

Applied Deep Learning techniques in Computer Vision to estimate a person’s age from facial images. Implemented a pretrained ResNet50 architecture with cross-validation.

**Definition of the problem:**

The Good Seed supermarket chain would like to explore whether data science can help it comply with alcohol regulations by ensuring that alcohol is not sold to underage individuals. You are asked to perform this assessment, under this conditions:

- The stores are equipped with cameras in the checkout area, which are activated when a person is purchasing alcohol.
- Computer vision methods can be used to estimate a person’s age from a photograph.
- The task, therefore, is to build and evaluate a model to verify the age of customers.


**Technologies Used:**

* Language: Python 3.10
* Environment: Jupyter Notebook
  * Main Libraries:
    * Pandas (data processing)
    * Math / Numpy / Random (numerical operations)
    * Matplotlib / seaborn (data visualization)
    * PIL (image manipulation)
    * Scikit-learn (modeling, validation and evaluation)
    * TensorFlow (deeplearning, neural networks and ResNet 50 architecture)
    * Google Colab (run into Google Colab)

      
**How to Run:**

* The dataset used for this project consists of approximately 7,600 labeled facial images for age estimation.
* Due to file size and licensing restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository.
* Due the the nature of the problem, it is recomended to perform the training using a GPU beacuse of the high ammount of computational resources needed.
